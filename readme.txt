## Echo of the Dead: Known Bugs
- Some text & buttons do not scale with screen size. This leads to small text at times or overlapping elements.
- User lag at times 
- Zombie movement is sometimes jittery
- Light torch and unlock door overlap at times (the blocks at the end)


Features We Didn't Get To:
- We wanted red damage haze to be more circular
- Hard difficulty is potentially too difficulty
- How to Play screen is not totally centered
- Background music does not loop
- Torches could potentially be more helpful
- Storytelling screen
- Surfaces don't have textures/sounds
