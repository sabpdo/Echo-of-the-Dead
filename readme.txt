# Echo of the Dead

## Known Bugs
- Some text & buttons do not scale with screen size. This leads to small text at times or overlapping elements. (this also tends to be very device dependent)
- User lag at times 
- Zombie movement is sometimes jittery
- Light torch and unlock door blocks at the bottom of the screen overlap at times if a user is near both a torch and a door
- Door asset is sometimes slightly larger than the actual door segment size
- Background music does not loop


## Features We Didn't Get To:
- We wanted red damage haze to be more circular
- Hard difficulty is potentially too difficult
- How to Play screen is not totally centered
- Torches could potentially be more helpful
- Storytelling screen
- Surfaces don't have textures/sounds
