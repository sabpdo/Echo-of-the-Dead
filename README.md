## Game Premise

Echo of the Dead is a survival platformer that fuses sound-based navigation and spell-driven combat to create a tense, immersive experience. The player relies on echolocation spells to perceive a dimly lit world overrun by the undead. The goal is to advance through a series of increasingly perilous rooms, defeating waves of zombies to unlock gates and ultimately shut down the central generator powering the horde.

At its core, this game emphasizes atmospheric audio design, limited visibility, and strategic survival through sound—the player’s greatest weapon is their ability to listen.
